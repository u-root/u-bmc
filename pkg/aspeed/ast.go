// Library for accessing AST2400/AST2500 series BMC functions
//
// Usually packages like these contain a notice to say use on your own risk
// but this time, it's for real. During development of this library a lot of
// hard hungs have been had and power cycles have had to be made.
// Be warned.
//
// The library generally does not save original registers, so any modification
// will be in competition to the local OS on the BMC. Safest course of action
// is to call FreezeCpu(), do your thing, UnfreezeCpu() + ResetCpu(). That
// should avoid any complications.
//
// Call aspeed.Open() and aspeed.Close() as the first and last thing
// before and after you want to run any library commands.
//
// The library supports being run both on the host CPU and the BMC CPU.
// When not run on the BMC, it will use the LPC bus and the LPC2AHB feature
// of the SuperIO. If that has been disabled, running on the host CPU will
// not work.
